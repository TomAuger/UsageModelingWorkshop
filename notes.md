## About Usage Modeling

* Comes from Software Design
* IA / UX best practice
* Map business objects, taxonomies, key interactions to user scenarios
* Objective: MVP

---

## UMW

Workshop that:

* Gathers stakeholders together
* Captures "edge" requirements
* Identifies User Groups
* Documents interaction patterns

---

## UMW Core Principles

* Must be facilitated
* Must generate artifacts
* Must quantify outcomes
* Focus on user scenarios, not requirements

---


##  Key Insights from UMW for Agencies

1. Focus on the end-users
2. User scenarios != business requirements
3. Quantification yields surprising insights
4. Cross-product creates weighted requirements

---

## Value of End-User focus

* UX is self-evident
* Consider full range of users, eg: admin UX
* Denombrilization, pivot

---

##  User Scenarios vs. Business Requirements

Sometimes they map, and sometimes they don't.

* eg: "contact us"
* eg: "donate books"

---

## Quantification

* Forces re-evaluation
* Disambiguates
* Builds consensus

---

## Cross-product

##  UMW Scoping Workshop Methodology

1. Pick a facilitator
2. Define Project objectives
2. Define User Groups
3. Identify user scenarios
4. Always quantify
5. Always document (artifacts)
6. Analyse results

---

##  Facilitator Responsibilities

* Watch your timings
* Add clarity, ask questions, paraphrase
* Document, create artifacts
* Maintain flow

---

##  What to do when you're stuck

* Subdivide
* Quantify, no equal % if possible!
* Find gaps
* Explore further
* Industry best practices
* Inverse ideas
* Improvise
* Know when to move on. And come back.

---

##  Project Objectives
### Establish context for the rest of the workshop

* Marketing objectives vs. Project objectives eg: "increase sales"
* Strategies vs. tactics (ie "features") eg "click the Donate Now button"
* 5-8 objectives are ideal
* Quantify and validate!

---

## Identify User Groups

* Consider internal and external users
* Refer to project objectives
* Get atomic, anticipate use cases
* Quantify, subdivide, regroup as necessary

---

##  Inventory User Scenarios
* What does the End User want to do?
* Goals not actions (*eg "fill out anonymous contact us form"*)
* Translate functional requirements into user-centric language (*eg view our educational presentation*)

---

## What to do with the artifacts?

* Document and capture
* Revise and report
* Tabulate and calculate

---

## What can the results reveal?

* Feature priority and MVP
* "Real" requirements vs. perceived requirements
* Budget and scope
* RFP specifications
